abstract = {Digital filters underpin the performance of coherent optical receivers which exploit digital signal processing (DSP) to mitigate transmission impairments. We outline the principles of such receivers and review our experimental investigations into compensation of polarization mode dispersion. We then consider the details of the digital filtering employed and present an analytical solution to the design of a chromatic dispersion compensating filter. Using the analytical solution an upper bound on the number of taps required to compensate chromatic dispersion is obtained, with simulation revealing an improved bound of 2.2 taps per 1000ps/nm for 10.7GBaud data. Finally the principles of digital polarization tracking are outlined and through simulation, it is demonstrated that 100krad/s polarization rotations could be tracked using DSP with a clock frequency of less than 500MHz.},

This chapter presents a survey of the elementary theory of the basic backpropagation neural network architecture, covering the areas of architectural design, performance measurement, function approximation capability, and learning. The survey includes a formulation of the backpropagation neural network architecture to make it a valid neural network and a proof that the backpropagation mean squared error function exists and is differentiable. Also included in the survey is a theorem showing that any L2 function can be implemented to any desired degree of accuracy with a three-layer backpropagation neural network. An appendix presents a speculative neurophysiological model illustrating the way in which the backpropagation neural network architecture might plausibly be implemented in the mammalian brain for corticocortical learning between nearby regions of cerebral cortex. One of the crucial decisions in the design of the backpropagation architecture is the selection of a sigmoidal activation function."

    abstract = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }

abstract = {This paper presents a novel digital feedforward carrier recovery algorithmfor arbitrary \$M\$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (\$M\$-QAM) constellations in an intradynecoherent optical receiver. The approach does not contain any feedback loopand is therefore highly tolerant against laser phase noise. This is crucial,especially for higher order QAM constellations, which inherently have a smallerphase noise tolerance due to the lower spacing between adjacent constellationpoints. In addition to the mathematical description of the proposed carrierrecovery algorithm also a possible hardware-efficient implementation in aparallelized system is presented and the performance of the algorithm is evaluatedby Monte Carlo simulations for square 4-QAM (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM.For the simulations ASE noise and laser phase noise are considered as wellas analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and internal resolution effects. Fora 1 dB penalty at \$\{\{\textblackslash\}rmBER\} $=$ 10^\{- 3\}\$, linewidth times symbol duration productsof \$4.1\{\textblackslash\}times 10^\{- 4\}\$ (4-QAM), \$1.4\{\textblackslash\}times10^\{- 4\}\$ (16-QAM), \$4.0\{\textblackslash\}times10^\{- 5\}\$ (64-QAM) and \$8.0\{\textblackslash\}times 10^\{- 6\}\$ (256-QAM) are tolerable.},
