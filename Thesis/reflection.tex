\section{Introduction}
During the bachelor end project, the process did not always go smoothly. In this document, arisen problems are discussed and reviewed.

\section{Reflection}
The biggest problem in my BEP was the slow start of the project. I had some background in artificial intelligence but not in photonics. The reason why I chose this project as my first choice was to learn even more about AI and to dive into the completely new field of science for me, optical communication. However, because I did not have any knowledge about the field, I had to start from the very basics and this went slower than expected. Only after half the project, I could understand the fundamentals of optical communication, optical impairments in glass fiber, and finally how optical coherent communication systems work. The reason why this took me so long was because I mainly did this on my own and material I had to learn from was not of high quality. This was because online sources were often not scientific or fundamental enough, and scientific papers at that point were still too hard to understand.

The second problem that happened during my whole BEP was that there seemed to be a lot of misunderstandings between me and my supervisors. Mainly because it was unclear for a long time what was expected from me and due to the difference in background knowledge between us. I had no background in photonics/optical communication, but I did in AI. For my supervisors, this was more or less the other way around. This sometimes led to confusions.

\section{Conclusion}
For my next projects, I need to be more communicative in what I expect from my supervisors, as I did not really get the help that I expected and not enough feedback was received. Appointments should be made more clear between me and the supervisors. Besides that, I have to be more explaining in work I did and the in background of the scientific fields where my supervisors did not know everything about, as there seemed to be confusions after telling things about my work or AI. Also, the other way around: I should have asked more about their background, as I often had trouble understanding what my supervisors meant.
